## One-line pitch

minitok gives AI coding tasks a workflow: research, plan, implement, verify, review, repair, and preserve evidence.

## Directory listing

**Title:** minitok — verified repository-aware coding workflow for AI agents

**Description:** minitok is a Node.js CLI that turns repository context into inspectable code changes through explicit research, planning, implementation, deterministic verification, review, repair, and evidence recording. The current published CLI is `@flotic/minitok@1.3.10`. It supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible providers with local-first execution and opt-in telemetry.

**Call to action:** Install with `npm install -g @flotic/minitok@1.3.10`, run `minitok doctor`, then initialize a repository with `minitok migrate`.

## VS Code Marketplace submission

**Display name:** minitok

**Tagline:** Run AI coding tasks through planning, verification, review, repair, and evidence.

**Categories:** AI, Other

**Keywords:** AI agent, coding agent, repository automation, verified coding, MCP, code review, developer tools.

**Marketplace description:** Use the repository's `extension/README.md` as the long description. Publish only the generated versioned VSIX after `npm run release:extension`, `npm run extension:marketplace:check`, and operator approval.

## MCP directory submission

**Name:** minitok MCP

**Transport:** local stdio and authenticated localhost HTTP; remote MCP is a separate explicitly configured deployment.

**Description:** Exposes repository-aware coding workflow controls to MCP clients with session authentication, entitlement enforcement, read/write policy boundaries, deterministic verification, and recorded evidence. It is not an AI model and does not replace the configured model provider.

**Configuration note:** Use the installed package's `minitok mcp connect <host>` output. Never publish tokens, customer JWTs, installation-token files, or provider API keys.

## Product Hunt launch copy

**Tagline:** AI coding with a verification loop, not just a code-generation transcript.

**Maker comment:** minitok is a repository-aware CLI for teams that want AI-assisted changes to be planned, implemented, verified, reviewed, repaired, and recorded. The product works with multiple LLM providers and keeps execution local-first. We are publishing the demo procedure and raw benchmark evidence instead of making unsupported speed or accuracy claims.

## Hacker News title and text

**Title:** Show HN: minitok – a repository-aware coding workflow with deterministic verification

**Text:** I built minitok to put explicit stage boundaries around AI-assisted repository work: research, planning, implementation, deterministic project checks, review, repair, and evidence recording. It is a Node.js CLI that supports several LLM providers and local-first execution. The README includes a disposable-repository demo and a reproducible benchmark format. Feedback on the workflow boundaries and evidence model is welcome.

## Reddit post

**Title:** I built a coding-agent workflow that makes verification and evidence first-class

**Body:** AI coding tools can generate changes quickly, but repository work also needs planning, project checks, review, repair, and a record of what happened. minitok is a Node.js CLI that separates those stages and supports multiple model providers. I am sharing the installable package, a disposable-repository demo, and a benchmark format that records raw runs, models, commits, costs, and manual interventions. I am looking for technical feedback rather than claiming universal superiority.

## LinkedIn post

AI-assisted coding needs more than generated diffs. minitok turns a repository task into an inspectable workflow: research, plan, implement, verify, review, repair, and evidence. It supports multiple LLM providers and local-first execution. The public demo and benchmark format focus on verification pass rate and manual intervention count, with raw evidence instead of inflated claims.

## Publishing rules

- Use one real demo recording and link the exact repository commit.
- Publish raw benchmark JSON with model, prompt, repository, cost, verification result, and intervention data.
- Do not claim guaranteed correctness, universal speedups, deployment proof, or AI-model status.
- Disclose paid plans and provider costs.
- Do not mass-post identical content or automate unsolicited replies.
