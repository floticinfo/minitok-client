# Product Hunt

## Product name
minitok

## Tagline
AI coding with a verification loop, not just code generation.

## Description
minitok is a repository-aware coding workflow CLI for teams that want AI-assisted changes to be researched, planned, implemented, deterministically verified, reviewed, repaired, and recorded as inspectable evidence. It supports multiple LLM providers, VS Code integration, and authenticated MCP transports, including a read-only HTTPS remote endpoint.

It supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible providers while keeping execution local-first. It also provides VS Code integration and authenticated MCP transports, including an HTTPS remote endpoint with read-only status and compaction tools. Telemetry is opt-in and disabled by default.

This launch focuses on the workflow and evidence model rather than unsupported speed or accuracy claims. The demo uses a disposable repository, and benchmark evidence should only be published when real paired runs are available.
