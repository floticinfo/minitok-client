# minitok Data Classification

> **Document type:** Technical data-processing boundary definition
> **Version:** 1.1.0
> **Last updated:** 2026-09-04
> **Applies to:** `@flotic/minitok` client v1.3.3 and compatible `minitok-server` v0.1.0 API

This inventory describes implementation boundaries. It does not establish legal classifications, retention obligations, or jurisdiction-specific rights.

## 1. Classification Categories

| Class | Label | Description | Transfer boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| D0 | PUBLIC | Public product and operational data | Publicly displayed or operationally shared |
| D1 | LICENSE | Activation and entitlement lifecycle data | MinTok server for activation and validation |
| D2 | BILLING | Account, subscription, and payment-event data | MinTok server and payment provider as required by the service |
| D3 | TELEMETRY | Sanitized allowlisted workflow metrics | MinTok server only after opt-in and entitlement gates |
| D4 | LOCAL_ONLY | User content and workflow content | Not sent to minitok server |
| D5 | SECRET | API keys, private keys, passwords, and token values | Not sent to minitok server; provider-specific credentials go only to their configured provider |

## 2. D4 — LOCAL_ONLY

Prompts, source code, file contents, command output, terminal output, generated code and text, knowledge entries, goals, summaries, decision traces, agent context, repository names and paths, LLM request/response content, and path-bearing error messages are outside the minitok-server telemetry payload. Configured LLM providers may receive the data required by the user's workflow.

## 3. D3 — TELEMETRY

The current client sanitizer and server endpoint allow exactly these fields:

| Field | Required | Values or range |
|---|---:|---|
| `status` | yes | `success`, `failure`, `partial` |
| `cycles` | yes | integer 0–100 |
| `duration_ms` | yes | integer 0–3,600,000 |
| `files_changed` | yes | integer 0–1,000 |
| `total_tokens` | no | integer 0–10,000,000 |
| `failure_category` | no | `lint`, `test`, `validation`, `type_error`, `timeout`, `api_error`, `unknown` |

Upload requires valid entitlement, the `evolution_upload` feature, explicit local opt-in, sanitizer success, a configured server URL and token, server-side customer/subscription/plan/feature validation, and schema acceptance.

## 4. D1 — LICENSE

The activation and entitlement flows process identifiers and entitlement attributes such as `entitlement_id`, `installation_id`, `plan_id`, `features`, `max_devices`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, and `key_id`. The server also accepts an optional activation `hostname`; the current server deletion path clears stored installation hostnames.

## 5. D2 — BILLING and Account Data

The server implementation includes customer email, customer/account status, subscription identifiers and status, payment and webhook event identifiers, activation metadata, and billing-provider identifiers. Payment details are handled by the configured payment provider; this repository does not define a complete legal payment-data notice.

## 6. D5 — SECRET

Secret values include LLM API keys, OAuth tokens, installation bearer tokens, Ed25519 private keys, JWT secrets, activation-key encryption keys, Dodo credentials, SMTP credentials, and npm tokens. Secret values are not part of telemetry. The installation bearer token is used for authenticated service requests, but its value is not included in telemetry fields.

## 7. Server Boundary

```text
Client -> minitok server: D1, D2, and conditional D3
Client -> configured LLM provider: workflow data required by the user's provider configuration
Client -> minitok server: not D4 or D5 payload values
```

## 8. Fail-Closed Behavior

Unknown classification, unknown consent, unknown entitlement, sanitizer failure, server validation failure, or missing credentials blocks telemetry transfer. This technical behavior does not determine whether a legal notice or consent mechanism is sufficient.

## 9. Operator and Legal TODOs

- TODO: Legal owner must approve personal-data categories, legal bases, controller/processor roles, international-transfer disclosures, and rights language.
- TODO: Operator must document retention and deletion behavior for account, billing, installation, audit-log, and backup copies.
- TODO: Operator must confirm whether hostnames, IP addresses, support messages, Sentry events, and infrastructure logs are included in the public data inventory.
